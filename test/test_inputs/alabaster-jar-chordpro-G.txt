{comment: Verse 1}
This alabaster [G]jar is all I have of [Bm/D]worth 
I break it at Your [Em7]feet Lord it's less than You de - [Cmaj7]serve 
You're far more beauti - [G]ful more precious than the [Bm/D]oil 
The sum of my de - [Em7]sires and the fullness of [Cmaj7]my joy 
Like You [G/B]spilled Your blood I [Cmaj7]spill my heart 
As an [Em7]off'ring to my [D/F#]King 

{comment: Chorus}
Here I [G]am, take [Bm/D]me as an [Em7]offer - [Cmaj7]ing 
Here I [G]am giv - [Bm/D]ing ev'ry [Em7]heartbeat for [Cmaj7]Your glory (To Ch.)
Take [G]me
