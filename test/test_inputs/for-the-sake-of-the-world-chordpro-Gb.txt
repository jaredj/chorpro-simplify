{comment: Verse 1}
[Gb]    I'm laying down my [Gbsus]life I'm giving up con - [Gb]trol
I'm never looking [Gbsus]back I surrender [Ebm7]all
I'm living for Your [Cb2(no3)]glory on the [Gb]earth        [Gbsus]

{comment: Verse 2}
[Gb]    This passion in my [Gbsus]heart this stirring in my [Gb]soul
To see the nations [Gbsus]bow for all the world to [Ebm7]know
I'm living for Your [Cb2(no3)]glory on the [Gb]earth        [Gbsus]

{comment: Chorus 1a}
[Gb]  For the sake of the [Cb/Gb]world burn like a fire in me

[Ebm7]  For the sake of the [Cb]world burn like a fire in [Gb]me  (To Turnaround)

[Ebm7] For every knee to bow [Cb]down for every heart to believe
