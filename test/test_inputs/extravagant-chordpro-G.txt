{comment: Verse 1}
[G]You were a lover before time's beginning
[Em7]You gave Your love freely withholding nothing
[C2]Jesus    my [D]Jesus
You [G]carried the weight of the world on Your shoulders
[Em7]You stopped at nothing to prove You were for us
[C2]Jesus    my [D]Jesus

{comment: Chorus 1a}
[G]     It's extravagant;  [D]    it doesn't make sense
[Em7] We'll never compre - [C]hend the way You love us
[G]     It's unthinkable;  [D]    only Heaven knows
[Em7] Just how far You'd [C]go to say You love [(G)]us (Last x)
[G]     To say You love [Dsus]us,   to say You love [Em7]us          [C2]

{comment: Verse 2}
[G]You don't belittle our pain and our suffering
[Em7]You comfort us in our greatest unraveling
[C2]Jesus    my [D]Jesus
[G]You are the dawn that is breaking within me
[Em7]You are the sun that is rising around me
[C2]Jesus    my [D]Jesus
