{comment: Verse 1}
[Eb]    Everything changed it’s getting harder to [Bb(4)]recognize
[Ab]    The person I was before I encountered Christ
[Eb]  I don’t walk like I used to I don’t talk like I [Bb(4)]used to
[Ab]  I’ve been washed from the inside
[Ab]  I’ve been washed from the inside [Eb]out

{comment: Chorus 1}
[Eb]   Hallelujah halle - [Bb(4)]lu - [(Ab)]jah
[Ab]    I know it was the blood could have only been the blood
[Eb]   Hallelujah halle - [Bb(4)]lu - [(Ab)]jah
[Ab]    I know it was the blood could have only been the [Eb]blood

{comment: Verse 2}
[Eb]    I cannot explain but nothing’s more [Bb(4)]real than this
[Ab]   In the presence of God oh what my heart experienced
[Eb]  When my shame hit the wayside and my sin met the [Bb(4)]Most High
[Ab]  I was washed from the inside
[Ab]  I was washed from the inside [Eb]out

{comment: Bridge}
It’s never been about per - [Eb]formance perfection or striving for acceptance [Bb(4)]
Let me [Ab]tell you it’s only by the blood
It’s never been about de - [Eb]serving or earning it’s a gift that’s freely given [Bb(4)]
Let me [Ab]tell you it’s only by the blood
Does anybody want to be [Eb]holy righteous purified and spotless [Bb(4)]
Let me [Ab]tell you it’s only by the blood
Does anybody want to be [Cm7]worthy forgiven [Eb]justified really living [Bb(4)]
Let me [Ab]tell you it’s only by the blood

{comment: Verse 3}
[Eb]    What can I say thank You is [Bb(4)]not enough
[Ab]    Jesus Your grace Your mercy poured [Fm7]out for us
[Eb]  I will love You forever here on earth into [Bb(4)]heaven
[Ab]  I’ve been washed from the inside
[Ab]  I’ve been washed from the inside [Eb]out
