{comment: Verse 1}
[Gm]   There's a [Gm/F]Name that levels [Ebmaj7]mountains 
[Gm]   Carves out [Gm/F]highways through the [Ebmaj7]sea 
[Gm] I've seen its [Gm/F]pow'r unravel [Ebmaj7]battles 
Right in front of me [Gm]   [Gm/F]   [Ebmaj7]
[Gm]   There's a [Gm/F]faith that stands de - [Ebmaj7]fiant 
[Gm]   Sends Go - [Gm/F]liath to his [Ebmaj7]knees 
[Gm] I've seen as [Gm/F]praise unravelled [Ebmaj7]shackles 
Right off my feet [Gm]   [Gm/F]   [Ebmaj7] 

{comment: Chorus 1a}
'Cause that’s the [Gm]power of Your [F]Name, just a [Eb]mention makes a [Bb]way 
Giants [Gm]fall and strongholds [F]break and there is [Eb]healing  [Bb] 
That’s the [Gm]power that I [F]claim, it’s the [Eb]same that rolled the [Bb]grave 
There’s no [Gm]power like the [F]mighty Name of [Eb]Je -  [Bb]sus  (To Tag 1)

{comment: Verse 2}
[Gm]   There's a [Gm/F]hope that calls out [Ebmaj7]courage 
[Gm]   In the furnace una - [Ebmaj7]fraid 
[Gm] The kind of [Gm/F]daring expec - [Ebmaj7]tation 
That ev'ry prayer I [Gm]make is on an [Gm/F]empty  [Ebmaj7]grave

{comment: Bridge}
[Bb] I see You taking ground, [Bbsus] I see You press [Bb]ahead 
[Bb] Your pow'r is dangerous to the enemy’s camp 
[Bb] You still do miracles,  [Bbsus] You will do what [Bb]You said 
[Bb] For You're the same God now as [Bb]You've always been 
[Gm7] Your Spirit [F]breaking out, [Eb] Your kingdom [Bb]moving in 
[Gm7] Your vict'ry [F]claims the ground that the [Eb]enemy had [Bb]  
[Gm7] You still do [F]miracles,  [Eb] You will do [Bb]what You said 
[Gm7] For You're the [F]same God now as [Eb]You've always been
