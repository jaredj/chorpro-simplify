Verse 1:
[Gm]There's a [Gm/F]Name that levels [Ebmaj]mountains 
[Gm]Carves out [Gm/F]highways through the [Ebmaj]sea 
[Gm]I've seen its [Gm/F]pow'r unravel [Ebmaj]battles 
Right in front of me [Gm]   [Gm/F]   [Ebmaj]
[Gm]There's a [Gm/F]faith that stands de[Ebmaj]fiant 
[Gm]Sends Go[Gm/F]liath to his [Ebmaj]knees 
[Gm]I've seen as [Gm/F]praise unravelled [Ebmaj]shackles 
Right off my feet [Gm]   [Gm/F]   [Ebmaj] 

Chorus 1a:
'Cause that’s the [Gm]power of Your [F]Name, just a [Eb]mention makes a [Bb]way 
Giants [Gm]fall and strongholds [F]break and there is [Eb]healing  [Bb] 
That’s the [Gm]power that I [F]claim, it’s the [Eb]same that rolled the [Bb]grave 
There’s no [Gm]power like the [F]mighty Name of [Eb]Je[Bb]sus (To Tag 1)

Verse 2:
[Gm]There's a [Gm/F]hope that calls out [Ebmaj]courage 
[Gm]In the furnace una[Ebmaj]fraid

That ev'ry prayer I [Gm]make is on an [Gm/F]empty [Ebmaj]grave

Bridge:
[Bb]I see You taking ground, [Bbsus]I see You press [Bb]ahead 
[Bb]Your pow'r is dangerous to the enemy’s camp 
[Bb]You still do miracles, [Bbsus]You will do what [Bb]You said 
[Bb]For You're the same God now as [Bb]You've always been 
[Gm]Your Spirit [F]breaking out, [Eb]Your kingdom [Bb]moving in 
[Gm]Your vict'ry [F]claims the ground that the [Eb]enemy had [Bb]  
[Gm]You still do [F]miracles, [Eb]You will do [Bb]what You said 
[Gm]For You're the [F]same God now as [Eb]You've always been
