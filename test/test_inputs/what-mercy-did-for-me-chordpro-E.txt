{comment: Verse 1}
[C#m]    I was [B]hopeless, I [A]knew I was [E]lost
[C#m]    Death and [B]darkness were [A]my only [E]songs
[C#m]    I needed [B]someone to [A]come rescue [E]me
Then [F#m]mercy heard my [Bsus]plea      [B]

{comment: Chorus}
Lord, You [A]found me, You [B]healed me, You [C#m]called me from the grave
You gave me a [A]real love, I thank You, [B]Jesus, You [C#m]washed my sins away
Oh, now I'm [A]living like I'm for - [B]given, You [C#m]came and set me [F#7]free
[A]    That's what Your [Am]mercy did for [E]me

{comment: Verse 2}
[C#m]    You gave me [B]beauty for [A]my guilty [E]stains
[C#m]    And now I'm [B]living day to [A]day by Your [E]grace
[C#m]    So, excuse [B]me if I can't con - [A]tain my [E]praise
'Cause I [F#m]know that I've been [Bsus]saved    [B]

{comment: Bridge}
[E]Every morning mercy will restore me, [A]I will pro - [E]claim
[C#m]Even if the [E/B]world may fall before me, [A]I will pro - [Am]claim
