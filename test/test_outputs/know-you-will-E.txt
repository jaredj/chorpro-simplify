Intro:
[|] [N.C.]       [||] [C#m]            [|] [E]                 [|] [C#m]            [|] [E]               

Verse 1:
When the [C#m]road runs dead, You can see a way I [E]don’t 
And it [C#m]makes no sense, but You say that’s what faith is [E]for 
[C#m]When I see a flood, You see a promise 
[E]When I see a grave, You see a door 
When I’m [C#m]at my end, You see where the future [E]starts 

Chorus:
I [(N.C.)]don’t know how You [C#m]make a way, but I [A]know You [E]will 
I don’t know how You [C#m]make a way, but I [A]know You [E]will 
You’ve been good on every [C#m]promise from Eden to Zion 
Through [B]every dead [A]end and out of that [E]grave 
I don’t know how You [C#m]make a way, but I [A]know You [E]will (I know You will) 

Verse 2:
When the [C#m]world’s on fire, it’s not like You [A]don’t have [E]a plan 
And when the [C#m]earth gives way, on this Rock Your [A]Church [E]will stand 
[C#m]Nothing has ever once sur[A]prised You 
[E]Nothing has ever made You flinch, and when it [C#m]all shakes out 
The gates of hell [A]don’t stand [E]a chance 

Bridge 1:
[A]You pulled my heart from [B]Egypt, [C#m]You carved a road through [B]sea 
From [E]all our chains to endless praise, [G#m]the story ends in You 

Bridge 2:
[A]And when we cross that [B]Jordan, [C#m]Look back at where we’ve [B]been 
From [E]all our chains to endless praise, [G#m]the story ends in You
